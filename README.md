# VS2017SudokuRep

I want to give a try to Visual Studio 2017 C++ Compiler.
This is the same toy project with SudokuApp.
Sudoku repository is using NetBeans IDE and MinGW compiler.
The project is not compiling with MS C++ compiler. 
Since MinGW compiler is compiling without a issue, IMHO there is definitly a compiler bug.
I've reported the issue to MS Developer Community. 
They replied the issue is triaged. I'm going to wait a few days. If MS does not provide solution
I'm going to adapt the program to C++ Version 14. 
Share the results.

The issue was with  my C++ compiler edition. At the end I am able to install the latest version of C++ compiler.
The problem now is solved
